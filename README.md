# Clock & Calendar DS Homebrew

A dual-screen Nintendo DS clock and calendar experience built with the devkitARM toolchain and libnds. The top screen renders an analog clock and calendar that can be rotated and toggled between light and dark themes. You can also have the calendar take over the bottom screen for a vertical view. (it currently does not work. lol.)

This is good for you to prop up your DS and glance at the time and date. your co-workers will be jealous of your sweet setup.

# The Vision

You kinda have to see the vision. My vision is to have a clock, a calendar. maybe a pomodoro timer, a to-do list, a battery indicator and some small glanceable things. Kinda like the ds-lite home screen, i took inspiration from that.
